{"title":"Revamp UI — always-visible terms cards and robust loader","body":"This PR revamps the index.html UI so all license terms are visible by default and cards stack cleanly without overlap. It also adds a robust JSON loader that tries a local `terms.json` first and falls back to the GitHub raw file if needed. Search, print, and Save-PDF remain supported.","head":"EntropyRedux:feature/revamp-terms","base":"main"}
